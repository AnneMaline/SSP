Chapter 1.1: Introduction to OSDU
## Overview of OSDU
The Open Subsurface Data Universe (OSDU) is an open-source, standards-based data platform tailored for the energy industry. It provides a unified framework for managing subsurface and energy data, enabling seamless data sharing and collaboration across organizations. OSDU is governed by The Open Group, a global consortium that develops and promotes vendor-neutral technology standards. The platform's primary goal is to standardize data formats and protocols, eliminating silos and enabling organizations to focus on extracting insights rather than handling data fragmentation
